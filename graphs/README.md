## Glossary

**Vertex** – Vertex (plural vertices) is a synonym for a node of a graph,
one of the points on which the graph is defined and which may be connected by graph edges.
Vertices of graphs are often considered to be atomic objects, with no internal structure.

**Edge** – An edge of a graph is one of the connections between the vertices of the graph.
Each edge has two or more vertices to which it is attached, called its endpoints.
Edges may be directed or undirected.

**Directed** – A directed edge is an edge with ordered endpoints.
A directed graph contains only directed edges.

**Undirected** – An undirected edge is an edge whose endpoints are not ordered.
An undirected graph only contains undirected edges.

**Mixed graph** - A mixed graph is a graph that can contain both directed and undirected edges.

**Walk** – A walk is a sequence of vertices, such that any two consecutive vertices are joined by an edge.
Note that two vertices are joined by a directed edge if and only if
the direction of the edge matches the sequence order of the vertices.

**Trail** – A trail is a walk in which all edges are distinct.

**Path** - A path is a trail in which all vertices (and therefore also all edges) are distinct.
